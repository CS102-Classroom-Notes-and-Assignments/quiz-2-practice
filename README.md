# quiz-2-practice

Quiz 2 is focused on the material from lesson 4 and 5. 

For this quiz, I will give you code blocks, and I will ask questions such as:  . 
1. Explain what is happening in the piece of code, as well as what it outputs
2. What type of variable is "longest"? (external, local, etc.) What is this variable being used for? 
3. How can this piece of code be improved? (a piece of this code should be written as a function, they should use a while loop instead, ...)


I may also ask you how to design a game:
1. What functions would you need? 
2. What variables or information do you need to store? Using what data types?

To study for the quiz, I'd review the code pieces in lesson-4 and lesson-5 and be able to describe what is happening. You will not be given a piece of code as complicated as Shell Sort, or any other sorting algorithm.
